# Frozen banana ice-cream

A super quick ice-cream made from frozen bananas! Who knew?

Especially good for the dairy free or vegetarian bods amongst you.

**Ingredients:**  
(serves 1)  
1 frozen banana  
1 heaped tsp raw cacao powder  
honey to taste  
teeny bit of good quality vanilla paste  
teeny bit of cinnamon -- don't overdo it!  
teeny pinch of sea salt  
_optional ~ nuts, dried fruit, peanut butter_

**Method:**  
1\. Freeze the banana, best done with the skin off (they only take a few hours)

2\. Chop the banana up and whizz it in a blender for a few minutes until smooth

3\. Add all the other ingredients and you're done! ~ Just amend the quantities and flavours as you wish

4\. If you fancy a topping, coconut, cacao nibs and berries work well!
